# Machine Learning Framework in R: From Data Acquisition to Model Deployment {#ml-framework_R}

A comprehensive framework outlining the key steps involved in leveraging machine learning techniques for analyzing microbiome data in R.

## Data Acquisition
- NCBI project: [PRJEB13870](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB13870)
- Title: Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to the development of hypertension (Zhao et al., 2017)

## Study Description
- Metagenomic and Metabonomics
- Fecal microbiota transplantation
- Identified dysbiosis of gut microbiome as a contributor to hypertension pathogenesis through metabolic effects alteration

## Data Cleaning and Tidying

2. Taxonomy table
3. Metadata
4. Metabolic pathways
5. Other experimental data...

## Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Diversity analysis
7. Taxonomic profiling
8. Differential abundance analysis
9. Functional profiling

## Feature Engineering
10. Dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)
11. Feature selection methods (e.g., Boruta, LASSO)

## Model Development
12. Selection of appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines)
13. Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
14. Model evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

## Model Interpretation
